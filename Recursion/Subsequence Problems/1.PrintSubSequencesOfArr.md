# Print SubSequences of Array

## Intuition
- Subsequences are the contiguous or non contiguous sequnce which follows the order of elements in an array.
- Example: ``` arr: 1 2 3 ```  
  Subsequences: ``` [1, 2, 3] [1, 2] [1, 3] [1] [2, 3] [2] [3] [1] ```  
  Number of subsequence for N size array: **2<sup>N</sup>**

- #### Template for solving subsequence problems:
    1. There is 2 rule either we need to pick element or not pick everytime when we have new element coming. So in first case will pick it and second case we will not pick it. 
    
    2. We will maintaian an answer container and a pointer to current index, we will visit each elem add it into our answer(for pick) again remove it from our answer(for not pick).

    3. And at the end when all of our elem are traversed we will print the elems present in the answer container.

    4. So our base case will be when our all elems are traversed (which means our i pointer reaches arr size).

- There will be 2 recursive call will be made:
    - First recursive call will be find all the sub sequences when current index elements is taken (means elem is added to ans container)
    - And second recursive call is for finding all sub sequences when current index element is not taken(means elem not added to ans container)

- Yoo, we broke down the concept.. Lets code

## Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void printSubSequences(int i, vector<int> &arr, int n, vector<int> &ans) {
    // base case
    if(i == n) {
        for(int num: ans) cout << num << " ";
        if(ans.size() == 0) cout << "{}";
        cout << endl;
        return;
    }

    // processing
    ans.push_back(arr[i]);
    printSubSequences(i+1, arr, n, ans); // pick 

    ans.pop_back();
    printSubSequences(i+1, arr, n, ans); // not pick
} 

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int n = arr.size();

    // ans container for storing subseqence
    vector<int> ans;

    // ptr to keep track of current index
    int i = 0;
    printSubSequences(i, arr, n, ans);

    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```bash
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 
1 2 4 
1 2 
1 3 4 
1 3 
1 4 
1 
2 3 4 
2 3 
2 4 
2 
3 4 
3 
4 
{}
```
