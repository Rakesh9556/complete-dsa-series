# Print any One Sub Sequence with Sum K

## Intuition
- This problem is same as [Print any one Sub sequence with Sum K](3.PrintAnyOneSubSeqWithSumK.md), but here instead of returning only one subsequence we will count and return the total no. of subsequence having sum K.

- **Technique to count subsequences having sum K** in any subsequence problem:
    
    1. Base case will **return 1** if condition satisfied(here: if subsequence found) else **return 0**.

    2. So, count the no. of subsequences present in first-half with sum K by calling the recursive method in first half(take part) similarly do for the second-half(not take part). 

    3. Calculate the total no of subseuence having sum K presnt by adding both.

    4. Here as we only need to return cnt so we will not maintain any ans container.

 **Template :**  
```cpp
   f(n) {
       if(baseCase) return 1;  
       else return 0;  
       l = f(n); // take  
       r = f(n); // not take  
       return l + r;  
   }
```

## Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int countNoOfSubSeqWithSumK(int i, vector<int> &arr, int n, int sum, int K) {
    // base case
    if(i == n) {
        if(sum == K) return 1;
        return 0;
    }

    // processing
    int l = countNoOfSubSeqWithSumK(i+1, arr, n, sum + arr[i], K); // take
    int r = countNoOfSubSeqWithSumK(i+1, arr, n, sum, K); // not take

    return l+r;
}

int main() {

    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int K = 5;
    int n = arr.size();

    // ptr to keep track of current index
    int i = 0;
    
    // variable to keep track of sum
    int sum = 0;
    
    cout << "Count: " << countNoOfSubSeqWithSumK(i, arr, n, sum, K);
    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```bash
Count: 2
```
