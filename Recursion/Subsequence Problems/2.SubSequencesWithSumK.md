# Subsequences with Sum K

## Intuition
- Inorder solve this problem first check it out the [Template for solving subsequence problems](1.PrintSubSequencesOfArr.md)
- So in previous problem(mentioned above) we are printing all subsequences of array, in that we are adding elem into ans container using 2 rule(pick and not pick), and at the end when our all elements are traversed(means i reaches n), we print the ans container.

- In order to solve this problem we need to minor tweaks to previous problem.

- During picking element(first half), we will also add the current element into sum variable and during not pick element(second half) we will subtract the element from the sum variable, and keep the sum variable updated everytime by passing it in recursive method.

- By doing this everytime our sum is calculated and updated when every sub-sequence is generated. 

- In the base case we will check evertime when sub-sequence is generated, the sum is equal to the desired sum or not, if its equal we will print that subsequence.

- Yoo, we broke down the concept.. Lets code

## Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


void printSubSeqWithSumK(int i, vector<int> &arr, int n, vector<int> &ans, int sum, int K) {
    // base case
    if(i == n) {
        if(sum == K) {
            for(int num: ans) cout << num << " ";
            cout << endl;
        }
        return;
    }

    // processing
    sum += arr[i]; // add current elem into sum in first half (take part)
    ans.push_back(arr[i]);
    printSubSeqWithSumK(i+1, arr, n, ans, sum, K); // take

    sum -= arr[i]; // subtract current elem from sum in second half(not take part)
    ans.pop_back();
    printSubSeqWithSumK(i+1, arr, n, ans, sum, K); // not take

}

int main() {

    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int K = 5;
    int n = arr.size();

    // ans container for storing subseqence
    vector<int> ans;

    // ptr to keep track of current index
    int i = 0;
    
    // variable to keep track of sum
    int sum = 0;

    printSubSeqWithSumK(i, arr, n, ans, sum, K);

    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```bash
1 4 
2 3 
```
