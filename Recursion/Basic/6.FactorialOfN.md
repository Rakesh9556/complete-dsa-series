# Factorial of number N

## Intuition
- Factorial of any number N is given by ```N * (N-1) * (N-2) *....* 2 * 1``` or by formula it is ```N * (N-1)!```
- Also ```fact(1) or fact(0) = 1```, so this will be our base case.
-So as per formula everytime we wil pick up N and multiply it with ```fn(N-1)```, we will call this recursively until we hit base case.
- This will efficiently calculate the factorial.

## Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int factN(int n) {

    // base case
    if(n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;

    // process + recursive call
    return n * factN(n-1);
}

int main() {

    cout << "Factorial: " << factN(6);
    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```bash
Factorial: 720
```
