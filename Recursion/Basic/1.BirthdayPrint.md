# A simple program to cheer for birthday

## Intuition
- Print the remaining days left for birthday and wish on arrival of birthday using recursion.

- The program takes 2 param as input
    1. name
    2. N = no. of days left for birthday

- When the 0th day come, the birthday comes, so here our base case is 0
- We will recursively reduce the N by N-1 until it reaches 0 and once reaches 0 we can wish for birthday.

## Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Print Birthday
void printBirthDay(int n, string name) {
    
    // base case
    if(n == 0) {
        cout << "Happy Birthday " << name << "!\n";
        return;
    }

    // computation / processing
    cout << n << " days left for birthday!\n";

    // recursive call
    printBirthDay(n-1, name);
}

int main() {

    printBirthday(10, "Rakesh");
    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```bash
10 days left for birthday!
9 days left for birthday!
8 days left for birthday!
7 days left for birthday!
6 days left for birthday!
5 days left for birthday!
4 days left for birthday!
3 days left for birthday!
2 days left for birthday!
1 days left for birthday!
Happy Birthday Rakesh!

```
