# Print number 1 to N in ascending order

## Intuition
- In order to print from 1 to N, first we need to reach to num 1.
- So we will make recursive call ```fn(n-1)``` until we reached 1.
- So our base case is 1. We need to stop recursion here and print number by going back from the recursive calls(backtracking).
- For this we will be use **pre-recursion**, which will allow us to reach to a base case first then print element by backtracking.

## Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Print number 1 to n ascending order
void print1toN(int n) {

    // base case 
    if(n == 0) return;

    // recursive call
    print1toN(n-1);

    // processing
    cout << n << " ";

}

int main() {

    print1toN(12);
    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```bash
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
```
