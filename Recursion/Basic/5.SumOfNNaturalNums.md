# Sum of N natural numbers

## Intuition
- We need to calculate sum of all numbers from 1 to N.
- For this we will pick up the num everytime and make recursive call for ```fn(n-1)``` and at the same time we add both (as we will not carry an extra variable for holding sum)
- As it was said to calculate sum of **natural numbers**, so when we reach **0** we wil stop.
## Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int sumOfNNaturalNums(int n) {
    
    // base case
    if(n == 0) return 0;

    // processing + recursive call
    return n + sumOfNNaturalNums(n-1);
}

int main() {

    cout << "Sum: " << sumOfNNaturalNums(12);
    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```bash
Sum: 78
```
